### _Fast QA pipeline creation using your data with [sentence-transformers](https://pypi.org/project/sentence-transformers/): model training and production-ready integration_

## Why is this needed?

_I personally use it to automate responses to frequent repetitive questions in tech support, but there are many possible use cases._

## How does it work?

Your questions and answers are converted into numerical vectors using a neural network model.  
`"How do I reset my password?"` → `[0.24, -0.12, 0.76, ...]`

The model does not look for exact word matches but calculates **semantic similarity** based on the angle between vectors.

The system understands **rephrased questions** thanks to:

- Considering word order
- Recognizing synonyms (`"reset password" ≈ "recover access"`)
- Multi-task model training

## Why is the Interactive Program Beneficial?

1. _Easily train a pipeline without writing custom code_
2. _Assemble a ready-to-use pipeline with your model and a built-in module for operation_
3. _Download any models directly in the program for offline training_
4. _Test your pipelines immediately after training—no need to constantly move folders into your project. Validate on the spot and check statistics_

## Training Strategies

`last` (_Default_)

**How it works:**

- Takes the answer with the same index as the question (`answers[i]`).
- If there are fewer answers than questions, it uses the last answer (`answers[-1]`).

**Example:**

    questions = ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3"]
    answers = ["A1", "A2"]

    Result:
    Q1 → A1, Q2 → A2, Q3 → A2 (last answer)

**When to use:**

- For "one question → one answer" pairs.
- When answers are ordered correctly for the questions.

##

`cycle` (_Cyclic_)

**How it works:**

- Reuses answers cyclically: `answers[i % len(answers)]`.

**Example:**

    questions = ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"]
    answers = ["A1", "A2"]

    Result:
    Q1 → A1, Q2 → A2, Q3 → A1, Q4 → A2

**When to use:**

- When there are more questions than answers.
- When answers are general-purpose (e.g., common hints).

  ##

`random` (_Random_)

**How it works:**

- Selects a random answer from the list using `random.choice(answers)`.

**Example:**

    questions = ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3"]
    answers = ["A1", "A2", "A3"]

    Возможный результат:
    Q1 → A3, Q2 → A1, Q3 → A3

**When to use:**

- To add variety to responses.

## Installation and Launch

**Requirements: Python 3.9+**

**Install dependencies:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt

**Add your training data to the `data/` directory**

> An example is provided in the `data/example.json` file.

**Launch the interactive program:**

    python main.py

## Integration with the Project

_The assembled pipelines with models are saved in the `build/your_pipeline` directory. This folder contains the `pipeline.py` module for working with the pipeline._

**Working with the assembled pipeline**

    from your_pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline

    pipe  = Pipeline()
    result  =  pipe.query("Shall we have a cup of coffee?")

    print(result)

**Result:**

    {
        "answer": "I suggest having a freshly squeezed juice",
        "score": 0.8474252223968506,
        "is_match": True,
        "strategy": "cycle"
    }

**Where:**

`answer` - _The answer_
`score` - _Confidence level of the answer_
`is_match` - _Has the pre-defined similarity threshold been exceeded?_
`strategy` - _Training strategy of the pipeline_

## In conclusion

_This program **will not create a real artificial intelligence**. It will only train a pipeline on existing data. It is not self-learning, it doesn't think, and it can't come up with answers. It simply helps to automate responses._
